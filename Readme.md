## Projects Overview 📄

### 1. **PacMan Maze Game 🟩**
Engineered a **PacMan** maze game from scratch using **Stack ADT**, focusing on achieving optimal time complexity for gameplay logic and movement. 🎮

### 2. **Cargo Management System 📦**
Designed a **Cargo Management System** using **AVL Tree ADT** to efficiently manage and allocate storage, optimizing operations in logarithmic time. 🚚

### 3. **Library Management System 📚**
Developed a custom **Library Management System** with **Hashmaps**, enabling efficient storage, quick lookups, and fast navigation for book and user management. 📖

### 4. **Straw Hat Crew Logic ⚔️**
Implemented custom **Straw Hat Crew** logic using **Heaps** to efficiently allocate treasures, ensuring optimal time complexity for treasure distribution. 💰

### 5. **Flight Planner ✈️**
Created a **Flight Planner** using **Graphs** to optimize flight routes based on time, price, and number of interchanges, ensuring the shortest and most efficient path in polynomial time. 🌍


## Important Notes ⚠️
- To run the test case 
    - For P1, P2, P3 & P5
    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```
    - Incase of P4
    ```bash
    python3 maindynamic.py
    python3 mainstatichash.py
    ```
- The `main.py` folder is not authored by me; it is a collection of test cases provided by my friends. 🤝
- Each project folder contains the problem statement in PDF format along with my solution code. 📖💻

Feel free to explore the projects and their respective solutions. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out! 😊
